# Project part a - CTS Regression Testing

## CTS Regression test plan generating system
## System Test Plan


## 1. Test Items

The software to be tested is the CTS Regression Test Plan Generating System. Detailed information on what the system does can be found in the requirement specification.

## 2.	Testing Tasks
* Design the system test
* Make sure that the environment needs are satisfied
* Perform system test

## 3.	Environment needs
### General Requirements:
* Windows or Linux Operating System
* Python 2.7

## 4.	Test case specification

### Test Items
This test case should verify whether the system has the function that can find out the failed test cases in the CTS report given and generate a test plan that only includes the failed test cases. Also, it should verify whether the file generated is in the expected format and has the expected file name.

### Input Specification
* Using different CTS reports generated after the CTS tests finished
* Run the system with the CTS Report

### Output Specification

The test plan generated by the system should only contain those reference identifiers referencing to the failed test cases as stated in the CTS Report. 

The test plan can then be used to run the CTS Regression test using the command “run – cts –plan regressionCTS”.
